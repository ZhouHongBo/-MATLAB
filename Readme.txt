./      ->      Common utility functions and sample usage Matlab scripts. Additionally, nearAPs.csv identifies the APs (columns in the database) that correspond to the 4 wireless devices closest to the collection area and provides the device position and the emitted AP's characteristics. 
db/     ->      Database measurements. Within it, each subfolder contains the measurements
				of each dataset that belongs to a collection month. Each dataset is represented
				by four files: the RSS, the time, the coordinates, and the identifiers files.
files/  ->      Matlab functions for loading the measurements.
ids/    ->      Matlab functions for filtering loaded samples.
ips/	->      Matlab functions provinding sample IPS methods.
